# Ride-Sharing-Dispatch-Simulator-Skeleton
Assigns drivers to riders based on closest distance and best rating
# how it works
Drivers are stored in a priority queue. When a rider requests a trip, the system picks the nearest (and if tied, the highestâ€‘rated) driver. Every trip is logged into history.
